This project demonstrates how to extract product information from an Amazon HTML page using Python. By leveraging the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping and Pandas for data manipulation, the script efficiently collects and organizes key details like product names, prices, and reviews.

**Features:**

**HTML Parsing:** Reads and parses an Amazon HTML page (amazon2.html).

**Data Extraction**: Scrapes product details such as names, prices, and reviews from the HTML content.

**Data Storage:** Organizes the extracted data into a structured Pandas DataFrame.

**Export to Excel:** Saves the extracted data to an Excel file (amazon_data2.xlsx) for easy access and analysis.

**Usage:**
Place your Amazon HTML file in the project directory and name it amazon2.html.
Run the script to generate an Excel file (amazon_data2.xlsx) containing the extracted product data.

**Requirements:**
Python 3.x
Pandas
BeautifulSoup4
