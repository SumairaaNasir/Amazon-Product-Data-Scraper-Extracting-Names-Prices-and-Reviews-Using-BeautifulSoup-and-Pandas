This project involves extracting product data from an Amazon HTML page using Python's BeautifulSoup library for web scraping and Pandas for data manipulation. The script reads an HTML file (amazon2.html), parses the content to identify specific product details such as the name, price, and number of reviews, and then stores this information in a Pandas DataFrame. Finally, the extracted data is exported to an Excel file (amazon_data2.xlsx) for further analysis or reporting. 
This project is ideal for those interested in web scraping and data extraction for e-commerce platforms.
